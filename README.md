# hello-world
Trying to learn how to use github? Me too! This is my first repository! 
I am a research evaluator who is trying to build my chops in R. I find it so much easier to read than outputs in SPSS or digging around in Excel, but I am not the best at writing code.  I hope to learn from everyone here, thank you for your support!
